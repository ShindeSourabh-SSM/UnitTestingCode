# Spring Boot Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito

This repository demonstrates unit testing in Spring Boot applications using JUnit for testing calculation logic and Mockito for mocking a product service. The examples include realistic scenarios to help you understand and implement testing best practices.

## Features
- **JUnit Testing**: Tests arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Mockito Testing**: Mocks a product service to simulate retrieving product details without actual database interaction.
- **Spring Boot Integration**: Fully integrated with the Spring framework for seamless testing.

## Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.8+ 
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse / STS4
